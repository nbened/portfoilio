        <p>I seek to breathe fire into my craft in every key stroke.</p>
        <p>I seek to remove ego to allow for pure creativity to flow.</p>
        <p>I seek to exercise and improve fitness daily.</p>
        <p>I seek to serve a team, a people, and a mission at every level.</p>

        
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">World Models</p>
        <p>World models are opinions formed with the intention of changing.</p>
        <p>World models can be graded and optimized based on their predictive capability.</p>
        <p>The world follows the same fundamental principles.</p>
        <p>Systems are driven by incentives.</p>
        <p>Hungry generalists will eat the world. </p> -->
